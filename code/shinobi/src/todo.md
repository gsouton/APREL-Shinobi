To implement the Shinobi module in Erlang, you need to consider the different operations described in the API and their behavior.

Prepare function: This function is used to start the Shinobi server. To implement this, you can create a process for the Shinobi server, which will manage the different operations and commands.

Register Command: To register a command, you need to store the command and its corresponding function in a map data structure, where the command name is the key, and the function is the value. To check if the command is already defined, you can use the function maps:is_key/2.

Operation function: This function starts the operation based on the keikaku. You can create a new process for each operation, which will traverse the keikaku, execute the sub-operations, and keep track of the results.

Ambush function: This function is called upon completion of the operation. You can keep track of the operation result and the callback function in a map data structure, where the operation ID is the key, and the result and the callback are the values.

Report function: This function returns the status of an operation. You can look up the operation result in the map data structure using the operation ID as the key.

In summary, you need to create a process for the Shinobi server, store the commands and their functions in a map, create a process for each operation, keep track of the operation result and callback in a map, and look up the result using the operation ID.
